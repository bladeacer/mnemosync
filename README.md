# mmsync

Short for mnemosync. A CLI tool that lets you add folders to backup manually to
a target Git repository.

The name is inspired by the Greek Goddess of memory Mnemosyne.

## Installation guide

This installation guide assumes you know how to create and set up a Git repository.

**Always backup your files before using mmsync**.

```bash
go install github.com/bladeacer/mmsync@latest
```

Ensure that you can access Go binaries in your $PATH.

```bash
mmsync
```

## Project status
WIP. See [this GitHub project](https://github.com/users/bladeacer/projects/3) for
the progress tracker.

This is my first project using the Go programming language, but I hope it will
be useful.

## Planned features
- Check if required binaries are available before calling the tool
  - Required binaries: `git, rsync, tar, zip`

- Help command line flag
___
- CRUD target directories which user wishes to backup e.g.

- Rsync to mirror said target directories to a `~/.mnemosync/folders`
  - Either manually triggered or we integrate `cron`
- Wrapper for user to manually copy the files and push them in their Git repository

- Wrapper to let user set default commit message format

## Planned CLI spec

TBC. View currently available options by running mnemosync without any flags or arguments.

There is also `mmsync man` for a generated manual page.

```bash
## Init and config
# Init the app with helpers to get the user to set path config and all
mmsync init 
mmsync config
mmsync config open
# Prints to stdout
mmsync repo get

## CRUD directories to mmsync before staging
# Save this in the local viewable db somehow each time the binary is called.
mmsync add <target_path> -a <optional_alias>
mmsync list
mmsync change <target_path-or-alias> <new-target_path-or-alias>
mmsync rm <target_path-or-alias>

## Find a mmsync path or alias that has been added
mmsync search <query-by-path-or-alias>

## Add warning for user to confirm if they wish to delete all directories they added
mmsync clear

# Backup related
## Technical info: staging is just rsyncing over to the target repo
## You can use . to include all directories and aliases

# rsyncs all added target mmsync directories or aliases to staging, and then
# calls git add in the target repo
mmsync stage <target_path-or-alias> 

# rsyncs unstages added target mmsync directories or aliases to staging 
# git restore --staged <target_path-or-alias> in the target repo
# somehow map aliases to directory names
mmsync unstage <target_path-or-alias> 

# get status of staging
# git status in the target repo
mmsync status

# get staging history 
# git log --oneline target repo
mmsync log

## get staging history limit in days before it is cleared. Defaults to 7 days
## and a max of 1024 MB. Limitation only enforced when the binary is called

## Need to read last modified time of each rsync mirrored directory or save its
## last modified time each time an operation is done on it.
## with confirmation message

mmsync get-hist-limit 
mmsync set-hist-limit -d <number_of_days> -s <max_size_in_mb>

# calls git restore --staged . and git restore . in the target repo
# with confirmation message
mmsync clear-hist # clears staging history

# set archive options
# write this option in the config file somehow
mmsync set-archiver tar|zip
mmsync get-archiver # gets archive tool used, defaults to tar

# Git related

## Configure commit messages
mmsync get-commit-fmt # Defaults to mnemosync archive ISO timestamp
mmsync set-commit-fmt <custom_format>

## checks if anything in staging, if yes it compresses writes the archive file
## over to be pushed
## if not, warns the user that staging is empty or files are not staged yet
## When pushing, write folder and filenames affected to viewable local db as
## part of staging history
## Also does the needed git commit and push on behalf of the user.
mmsync push 

## Respecting .gitignore
## mmsync respects gitignore in the target repo when adding directories or aliases
## Returns true or 1 by default
## When setting to 0, warning + confirmation
mmsync get-ignore 
mmsync set-ignore 0|1
